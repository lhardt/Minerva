 *   And class C needs subject D,
 *     If A has 4 free periods and C needs 5 periods of D,
 *       Then A cannot teach D to C.

 *

 *            L1 and L2 can not happen in their last meeting;

 *            L3 can not happen in their second meeting;
 *
 * Things to consider:
 * - This creates an order between periods;
 * - Therefore it must happen after any user interference (because messing with one period messes with all the other twins);
 * - But it may be reversed as L1.possible = L1.possible U L2.possible U L3.possible.
 * - make sure we do not include fixed meetings in the reversal union.

 *          - 2 C cannot attend any other lecture at P;
 *		    - 3 R cannot be allocated at P by any other meeting;
 *			- 4 T teaches C in all periods of S for C;
 *			- 5 R accomodates every period of S to C;
 *			- 6 Any super/subordinate of T cannot lecture at P;
 *			- 7 Any super/subordinate of C cannot attend lectures at P.
 *
 * Things to consider:
 * - TODO This algorithm **should** work even if one of the parameters (A,C, or R)
 *        is not set. The exclusion, then, happens only partially.

 *	 If class C has room R for a discipline D,
 *		 Then no teacher which needs more than those features cannot lecture D to C;

/* TEACHER MAX PER DAY RULE:
 *
 * Logic Type: Teacher-Period;
 *
 * Basic Explanation:
 *   If teacher T already teaches Nt classes in a day Dk and his maximum is Nmax:
 *       Then, for any group of non-allocated analogous meetings Mg(M1,M2, ...):
 *			then only more (Nmax-Ntk) meetings in Mg can happen in Dk (otherwise Nt would be bigger Nmax).
 *
 *			Consider the days that thome meetings can happen (D1, D2, ..., Dz)
 *				On D1, just the first (Nmax-Nt1) periods can happen
 *      	    On D2, just the first (Nmax-Nt1-NP(D1)) can happen,
 *      	    On D3, just the first (Nmax-Nt1-(NP(D1) + NP(D2))) can happen.
 *			It also happens in reverse order:
 *				On Dz, just the last (Nmax-Nt1) periods can happen
 *				On Dz-1, just the last (Nmax-Nt1-NP(Dz)) periods can happen
 *				On Dz-2, just the last (Nmax-Nt1-NP(Dz)-NP(Dz-1)) periods can happen
 *
 *			where NP(k) is the number of periods that those meetings can happen in Day K
 * 				(it is obvious that if NP(k) <= Nmax for any k)

 *		Then no more lectures of G can happen in that day
 *
 * Things to consider:
 * - The algorithm can be made to have the hindsight of the function above.

 *
 * Basic Explanation:

 *
 * Things to consider:
 * - "limit" above is not a single quantity. It may be
