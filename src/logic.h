 *            L1 and L2 can not happen in their last meeting;

 * - This creates an order between periods;
 * - Therefore it must happen after any user interference (because messing with one period messes with all the other twins);
 * - But it may be reversed as L1.possible = L1.possible U L2.possible U L3.possible.

 *
 * Logic Type: Teacher-Period;
 *
 * Basic Explanation:

 *			then only more (Nmax-Ntk) meetings in Mg can happen in Dk (otherwise Nt would be bigger Nmax).

 *				On D1, just the first (Nmax-Nt1) periods can happen
 *      	    On D2, just the first (Nmax-Nt1-NP(D1)) can happen,
 *      	    On D3, just the first (Nmax-Nt1-(NP(D1) + NP(D2))) can happen.
 *			It also happens in reverse order:
 *				On Dz, just the last (Nmax-Nt1) periods can happen
 *				On Dz-1, just the last (Nmax-Nt1-NP(Dz)) periods can happen
 *				On Dz-2, just the last (Nmax-Nt1-NP(Dz)-NP(Dz-1)) periods can happen
 *
